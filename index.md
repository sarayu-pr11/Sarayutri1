    <th>Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?</th>
    <th>Three benficial effects of computing would be the intorspective knowledge a person can receive from the various perspectives the encounter, the different tools and skills that we have to acquire, and lastly the trial and error we have to go through to be successful. These are all various benefits of computing. However, some harmful effects of computing would be the many predators that lurk online that usually make victims out of kids. Practicing and knowing how to be safe online is a neccessary skill that everyone needs to know how to carry through. Dopamine issues are a very real problem in this generation. I can attest to this fact since I have chosen to spend tme on my phone for many hours at a time when I should've been doing homework or studying for a test. Something that is impacting my own success in high school would be lack of motivation with my classes.</th>
