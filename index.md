      <th>Many people spend more time on the internet than sleeping
Imagine your life without WWW!
Dopamine feedback loops
Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended
Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovation can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses
Microtransactions:
Free games/apps
cosmetics/pay-to-wins/paywalls to functionality
Gold, v-bucks, coins, chips, SBUX
Loot boxes that are banned in some countries
One of the ways computing innovation can be used may have a harmful impact on society, economy, or culture
It isn’t possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used
Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer

5.2 Notes:
Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
The digital “divide” is the differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, and/or demographic characteristics
Demographic includes:
Age
Religion
In some countries:
Computers aren’t common in rural areas
Only a small number of website available
The internet is used to protect/advocate the government
There’s a high level of monitoring on the internet to protect the government
The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals
The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
        The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments</th>

    <th>Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?</th>
    <th>Three benficial effects of computing would be the intorspective knowledge a person can receive from the various perspectives the encounter, the different tools and skills that we have to acquire, and lastly the trial and error we have to go through to be successful. These are all various benefits of computing. However, some harmful effects of computing would be the many predators that lurk online that usually make victims out of kids. Practicing and knowing how to be safe online is a neccessary skill that everyone needs to know how to carry through. Dopamine issues are a very real problem in this generation. I can attest to this fact since I have chosen to spend tme on my phone for many hours at a time when I should've been doing homework or studying for a test. Something that is impacting my own success in high school would be lack of motivation with my classes.</th>

     <th>How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?</th>
     <th>Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by making sure they know how to navigate safely. Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by teaching them the correct way to navigate the online world. Something we can do at DNHS would be to have a course on online safety. Red tape blocking is not digital empowerment since it prevents people from making the choice to navigate away themselves. There are such barriers at Del Norte in the form of restricting websites. Elsewhere also there are many restrictions in a day to day life on the online world.</th>
